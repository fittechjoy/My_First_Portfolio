  <h1>Welcome to My First Portfolio Website</h1>
  <p>Hi there! I'm Joy, and this is the beginning of my journey into web development. I'm passionate about creating meaningful digital experiences.</p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>In 2024, I started a fitness journey that helped me heal and grow. Now, I'm combining that drive with tech to build my dream life.</p>

  <h3>My Tech Goals</h3>
  <p>I'm currently learning front-end web development — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal is to become a creative and skilled developer who builds tools that help people grow.</p>

  <p>When I'm not coding, you'll find me at the gym, on road trips, or spending time with my boys, Jacob and Jabali, they are my biggest motivation.</p>
